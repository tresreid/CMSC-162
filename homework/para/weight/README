BUILDING

This is the source directory for the atomic-weight directory.  To build the
program, simply

	% make

This will compile atomic-weight, and copy ./mass_data to ~/.mass_data.
The latter is the element database file that atomic-weight relies on.
The program can be tested by running

	% make test

which will compute the mass of Octane [CH3(CH2)6CH3], which should be
114.228520.

RUNNING

The program runs in one of two modes.  If command line arguments are
specified, they are interpreted as chemical formulae, and the weights
are reported one per line, in argument order.  If no command line arguments
are reported, the program attempts to read chemical formulae, one per line,
and reports their weights.

INSTALLING

The program can be installed by

	% make install

This will copy atomic-weight to ~/bin, assuming ~/bin exists.

BUGS

The program should really look the database file in a number of locations --
per system, per user, and per directory.  This isn't hard to do, it's just
hard to do elegantly.

The code is radically inadequately commented.
