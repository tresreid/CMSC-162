Jeff's notes for Tres
* Include your source.
* You can get rid of a lot of your brackets, whenever if or else if or else is a one liner.
* Looks like we used the same algorithm!
* Looks like 42^7 still doesn't work.

*changed to unsigned type so there is no overflow.
*put your main function in a different .c file so you can use the same I/O with different exponentiation algorithms
*document your code
