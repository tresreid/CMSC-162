Problems:                               Solution:
the files never close -			use fclose at the end 

overflow error with words over 100	use fread instead of fscanf so
characters (shouldn't normally be a  	there is no longer an overflow.
problem but it is with segfault.txt

spaces are thrown out			use fread instead of fscanf.


*using fread also seems like the way to make the program more efficent.
