Problems:                               Solution:
the files never close -			use fclose at the end 

overflow error with words over 100	use fread instead of fscanf so
characters because of buf[100] 
(shouldn't normally be a problem	there is no longer an overflow.
but it is with segfault.txt)

spaces are thrown out			use fread instead of fscanf.


*using fread also seems like the way to make the program more efficent.
